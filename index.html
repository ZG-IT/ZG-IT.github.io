         <h2>About Us</h2>
         <p>The ZGIT Information Department was established in 1902 at Times Square in Central New York, USA, because the United States needed an information department to combat the Russian KGB. The KGB was an important information defense agency in Russia, and searching for confidential information from the United States all year round had already caused great trouble for the United States. Because the CIA could not keep an eye on the KGB, the United States established ZGIT, but the Illuminati did not agree, The Illuminati is the second political party in the United States, and many things are up to the Illuminati. However, the United States does not want to be held in the dark, so it secretly established ZGIT and operates on the Onion Route dark network, which was invented by the CIA for confidential communication. We have participated in many information wars, and we need to be highly vigilant. We not only need to keep the KGB, but also be careful of the Illuminati. When Hitler was about to fail in the later stages of World War II, we launched the largest information war in history, the KILLHITLER information war. The main attack method was to deploy a large number of informants, gather Germany's next steps, assassinate Hitler as much as possible, and provide feedback to the CIA. After World War II, ZGIT withdrew from confidentiality, but still did not inform the public. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the United States was shocked throughout the country. No one expected that the Chinese people would be so powerful. During the Korean War, the United States believed that China's military was weak and easy to defeat. However, the United States was wrong. China won, which once again shocked the entire United States. At the same time, it made it clear that their biggest enemy at that time may not have been the Soviet Union, but China, which was about to rise. So ZGIT was called back again to observe China. Because Turing invented the computer, and with the improvement of the computer, we have become different from before. With the computer, our hands can reach further, we can attack other countries, implant trojans, and obtain secrets. Since then, ZGIT has been working, but by 2011 it was different. The CIA's technology in the United States had reached its peak, and the United States no longer needed ZGIT because the CIA could complete all tasks in the United States at that time, Then the United States withdrew ZGIT from confidentiality, and its members drifted to civilian communities around the world to continue fighting the information war... Now ZGIT is just a civilian organization, and you may not have heard of us, but we know your information. We are not a spy agency because in 2012, we secretly defected to China. We believe that China has high potential, while the United States is a grasshopper in the autumn. After only a few days of jumping around, the United States was very bad to us, so we defected to China. So now ZGIT is a non confidential organization in China, and we are conducting civilian investigations into the PC incident and searching for American spies.</p>
